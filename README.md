Simple university admin site built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node).

Local setup:
npm run watch in the root folder and npm start in the client folder to run locally.

You will need to create a MongoDB database with a students collection and a subjects collection either locally or in the cloud.

You will need to make a .env file with the following config var:
DB_URI=[your MongoDB database connection]
